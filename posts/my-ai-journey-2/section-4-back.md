If the AI writes the syntax, what is left for us?

The answer isn't "nothing." The answer is "everything else." When the cost of generating code drops to zero, the value of **judgment** skyrockets. We are moving from a world where we are limited by how fast we can type to a world where we are limited by how well we can think.

### From Bricklayer to Director
We used to be bricklayers. We defined explicit logic, line by line. Now, we are becoming directors.

As Patrick Debois notes, we aren't just writing code; we are orchestrating agents. This sounds fancy, but in practice, it means we are responsible for the *vision* of the system. If you don't have a clear architectural vision, your AI agents will happily build a sprawling, incoherent mess at 1,000 words per minute.

The new skill isn't "prompt engineering"—that’s just syntax for the new age. The real skill is **System Design**. You need to know *what* to build, because the machine will build exactly what you ask for, bugs and all.

### Managing the Jevons Paradox
There is an economic principle called the Jevons Paradox: as technology increases the efficiency with which a resource is used, the total consumption of that resource increases rather than decreases.

Making code easier to write won't mean we write less code. It means we will drown in it.

Our systems are about to become exponentially more complex because the barrier to adding "just one more feature" is gone. The engineers who thrive will be the ones who practice **Complexity Theory**—understanding that simple functions can yield chaotic results when they interact. We need to stop obsessing over the perfect function and start obsessing over the resilience of the system. As Richard Cook said, "complexity is the source of outages."

### The "Think Out Loud" Mentorship
In Section 3, I mentioned the "Junior Reviewer Paradox"—the danger of juniors reviewing code they couldn't write. The solution is to change how we mentor.

Advice is the worst form of mentorship. Telling a junior "use this pattern" doesn't help them when the AI generates a different one.

We need to switch to an apprenticeship model based on **thinking out loud**. When you debug a nasty race condition, don't just fix it. Pull a junior into a call (or a screen share) and narrate your internal monologue. Show them the confusion, the dead ends, and the hypothesis testing. The AI can give them the answer, but only you can teach them the *process* of finding it.

### Context Engineering
Finally, there is a new technical skill emerging: **Context Engineering**.

If "Context is King" for LLMs, then managing that context is a critical engineering discipline. It involves:
*   Deciding what documentation the AI sees.
*   Structuring specifications so they are unambiguous to a machine.
*   Knowing when to "reset" the context window to stop the model from spiraling into hallucination.

This isn't just administrative work. It's the new form of coding. You are debugging the prompt, not the variables.

### The Verdict
We aren't partially automated away. We are being promoted to a role that requires higher-order thinking, whether we like it or not. The "make it work" phase is over. The "make it scalable, secure, and maintainable" phase is all that's left.
