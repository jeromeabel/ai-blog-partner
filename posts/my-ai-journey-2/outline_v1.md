My Ai Journer - part 2 : A Balanced Shift

1. The "Big Shift": Navigating the Fog

    The Context: It’s hard to evaluate the magnitude of a storm when you’re standing inside it.
    The Validation: Listening to industry veterans (Fowler, Orosz) confirms: this is different. It validates the "Imposter Syndrome" or "Guilt" new developers feel.
    The Challenge: It’s a force multiplier, but it’s non-deterministic. Ironie of automations -> harder

2. The Promise of Productivity (and How to Measure It)

    The Promise: We are sold on "10x speed," but the reality is messy.
    The Frameworks: Forget "Lines of Code" (that's a vanity metric). We need to look at frameworks like SPACE or DX to measure actual impact.
    The nuance: Productivity isn't uniform. It depends on the task (Greenfield vs. Legacy) and the "Context Length" of the problem, and ...

3. The deshumanize Trap

    The "Average" Trap: If we blindly accept AI output, we regress to the mean.
    The "Dehumanization" Trap: We start writing docs for machines (prompt-stuffing), not for human understanding.
    The Conflict: Solo adoption is fun (YOLO mode), but Team adoption is hard (more Reviews, more code, more bugs, with the same amount of people, Security, Trust, Tests can be the bottleneck, Debug, Context switching). The skills to debug:  because we'll have automated away whole chunks of the system, we'll be less equipped to jump in and debug it when things go wrong. 
    The Pressure: The tension between "Experimentation time" (learning) and "Production pressure" (shipping).

4. The Opportunities ( Evergreen Skills)

    New Roles: Shift from "Code Monkey" to "Orchestrator" or "Director."
    Introspection: We need to analyze our own gestures. How do we explain code? How do we debug? (The "Socratic" method with AI).
    Sharing: The way out is through sharing real experiences, not just consuming hype. new roles, redesign our workflows/ experiment new usage, shares,

    Teaser: The next post will focus on the practical "How": Context Engineering & Teacher Mode.
