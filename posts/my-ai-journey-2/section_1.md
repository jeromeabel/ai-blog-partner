# 1. The "Big Shift": Navigating the Fog

After the JavaScript fatigue, are we entering the **AI fatigue**?

I’ll be honest: I’m relatively new to this industry, and this rapid evolution induces a specific kind of discomfort. The tech radar is saturated with AI news, tool releases, and "game-changing" demos. It creates a constant background pressure—a fear that if you aren't adapting *now*, you are already obsolete.

For someone early in their career, this fog is dense. You spend hours experimenting with tools, wondering if you are investing in the future or just wasting time. The visibility on "what skills will matter in 5 years" drops to zero. You feel the **FOMO**, and more acutely, the **guilt** of not being fast enough.

### The View from the Top
But there is a way to see over the fog: listen to the people who have seen previous shifts.

When I heard industry veterans like **Martin Fowler** and **Gergely Orosz** discuss this[^1], something clicked. They weren't just nodding along to the hype; they were acknowledging that this feels like the **biggest technology shift of their professional careers**.

This was a massive relief. It confirmed that the confusion isn't a "junior" problem. It’s an "industry" problem. **This is a big shift for everyone.** We are all—from juniors to principal engineers—trying to find our footing on shifting sand.

### A Balanced Mindset
Once you accept that *everyone* is struggling, you can stop panicking and start evaluating the shift for what it is. It helps to adopt a **balanced mindset** to understand why this feels so different from learning a new framework.

**1. The Paradigm Shift: Non-Determinism**
We are moving from deterministic tools (which do exactly what we say) to non-deterministic assistants. This introduces **chaos**—not just for the solo developer, but for the entire team. Scaling a product becomes harder when the underlying code generation isn't strictly predictable. It forces us to build tolerance for ambiguity into our very infrastructure.

**2. The "Intelligence" Trap**
Morten Rand-Hendriksen argues that the word "Intelligence" gives these tools too much credit. We should think of them as **Assisted Technologies**[^2]. Our brains are wired to find patterns—like seeing a face in a cloud or "reasoning" in a probabilistic text stream. This psychological effect makes us trust the machine more than we should. We project intent where there is only math.

**3. The Irony of Automation**
If using AI feels exhausting, there is a reason. It’s called the **Irony of Automation**[^3]. The theory states that partial automation makes the residual job *harder*, not easier.
*   The AI automates the easy parts (boilerplate, syntax, common patterns).
*   The human is left with the hard parts (judgment, edge cases, debugging complex failures).
*   **Result:** Your "typing" time goes down, but your "thinking intensity" goes up.

### The Foundation Remains
This leads to the ultimate reassurance: **Things that don't change.**

The foundation of engineering is more critical now than ever. As Simon Willison notes, the skills that make someone a senior engineer—designing systems, managing complexity, knowing what to automate vs. hand-code—are exactly what yield the best outcomes with AI[^4].

If you have weak foundations, AI just helps you build a bad system faster. If you have strong foundations, it becomes a lever. The job isn't disappearing; it's just demanding that we stop being bricklayers and start being architects.
