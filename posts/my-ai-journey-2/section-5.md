As the "Big Shift" continues, engineering excellence is being redefined. Here is what will matter in the next era:

### 1. Engineering Leadership: Moving Beyond the Fog

We need nuanced feedback from senior developers who can see through the marketing fog. Successful AI adoption requires investing in mentoring and creating deliberate space to learn (Michelle Rush)

### 2. Deliberate Learning

Those who benefit most from AI aren't casual users; they are deliberate learners. Much like learning an instrument, progress comes from intentional practice—experimenting, failing, and refining mental models rather than expecting perfect answers on the first try.

> In the circles around me, the people who are getting the most out of AI have put in deliberate, intentional practice. They don't just pick up a guitar, experience failure, and then go, "Well, it got the answer wildly wrong," and then move on and assume that that will be their repeated experience. (Geoffrey Huntley [^19])

### 3. A Curriculum for Foundation Skills

In a world that feels increasingly chaotic, foundations become the anchor. The how is getting cheaper; the why — architecture, system boundaries, user intent — is becoming the real asset. For Michelle Rush, Systems thinking, reliability engineering, and comfort with complexity are no longer optional.

> "The new scarce skill is writing specs that fully capture intent and values" (Sean Grove, OpenAI)

### 4. Reclaiming the Joy of Craft

Embracing AI shouldn't mean surrendering agency. Keeping a "human in the loop" is about more than just control; it’s about maintaining our ability to learn.

Sometimes, the right move is to **"code naked"**—turning the AI off to write a module from scratch. We don't do this for speed, but because writing code remains one of the most effective ways we have to think. By shifting into "Teacher Mode," we use AI not as a shortcut, but as a partner for deeper exploration.

So, what will make us good engineers in the future?

**1. Engineering leadership**: I think we need more nuanced feedbacks from senior developers - see through the marketing fog. Michelle Rush stands for investing in mentoring, and creating space to learn.

**2. Delibarate Learning**:
Those who benefit most from AI are not casual users, but deliberate learners. Like learning an instrument, progress comes from intentional practice — experimenting, failing, reflecting, and refining mental models over time, not from expecting perfect answers on the first try.

**4. Find the new joy of crafting**:
Embracing AI does not mean surrendering agency. Keeping a human in the loop is not only about control, but about learning. Sometimes, the right move is to turn the AI off — to “code naked” — not for speed, but because writing code is still how we think.

I think the next bpost would be around the idea of useing AI as a partner, in a teacher mode:  using AI not as a shortcut, but as a tool for deeper learning.

**Leading Through the Shift**

AI isn't a replacement for leadership; it’s a catalyst for it. We need more nuanced, senior-level feedback and a deliberate investment in mentoring. This means moving away from a "predictable" project mindset and creating intentional space for learning. We should "think out loud"—bringing junior devs along as we solve problems to explain the *why* behind our decisions, not just the resulting code.

### The Guitar Theory of AI

Mastering these tools requires **deliberate learning**. It’s like picking up an instrument:

They don't just pick up a guitar, experience failure, and then go, "Well, it got the answer wildly wrong," and then move on and assume that that will be their repeated experience.

### Foundations Over Hype

Chaos demands a return to the basics. As the "How" of coding becomes a commodity, the "Why"—architecture, business logic, and user intent—becomes our premium asset.

* **The Spec is the Product:** The new scarce skill is writing specifications that fully capture human intent and values.
* **Deep Skills:** We need to double down on system thinking, non-abstract system design, reliability engineering, and complexity theory.

### Finding the Craft

Embracing the chaos means moving from a mindset of "control" to one of "teacher mode." To keep the joy of the craft alive, we have to remain the "human-in-the-loop" by choice, not just by necessity.

* **Code naked.** Occasionally, turn the AI off.
* **Think by Typing:** Write a module from scratch to keep your syntax skills sharp. We don't type just to produce characters; we type because it's how we think.
