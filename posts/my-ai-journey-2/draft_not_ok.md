# TITLE: My Ai-Journey part 2: A Balanced Shift

<!-- Chunk #2 -->
## AUDIENCE

<!-- Chunk #3 -->
FOCUS on developers, teams tech industry: human feeling, secure jobs, be ready, share experiences

<!-- Chunk #4 -->
## FIRST IDEA OF A PLAN

<!-- Chunk #5 -->
- evaluate the shift (==BIG==, ==HARDER==), pressure on us (FOMO), seniors feedbacks (very useful, if not imposter syndrome AI fatigue, so hard to evaluate we are inside the movement, so hard for a quite new person in the industry), paradigm non determinist tool, force multiplier
- evaluate the promise of productivity, how to measure, results are not unanime, there are bad experiences
- list & listen to negative impacts/experiences to address them! (teams adoption, reality dilemna, skills, confiance, déresponsabilisation, context switching, reviews, AI Makes Everyone Average, a lots of docs for machines/not humans(paradox of spec driven))
- Opportunities, embrace chaos. the interesting parts (specs/code/artefacts, role of coding/high level task, conversations/ihm une nouvelle façon de communiquer avec les machines au delà de la commande, deliberate learning/invest in mentoring & learning, orchestrator/more PM skills, ship prototypes / test ideas in YOLO MODE, dev workflows (introspection de ces propres gestes, vocabulaires, tâches) ), find joy/pleasure in craft
- Open questions: what and how to get the hard skills fondations/hard parts
- ENDING: NExt blog post will be more practical - Keep Human in the workflow -> Teacher mode experiments with LLM

PROBLEMES
- productivity/metrique
- problème: sert à justifier des décisions: biais de confirmation, ne fait pas confiance aux autres membres de l'équipe -> CONFIANCE, DERESPONSABILISER
- problème: discussion où on s'adapte (ne comprend pas l'implicite) > effet pervers sur les autres discussions entre humains
- problème: organisation, équipe, adoption
- problème: flow / context switching : plus de code, plus de revue, plus de PR, plus de feeback avec des temps difference, plus de branches reliées entre elles, en attente de validation

<!-- Chunk #10 -->
---

<!-- Chunk #11 -->
INTERESTING PARTS
- intéressant: nouvelle interaction home/machine, la conversation -> socratic method, This chain of thought
	- duck buddy, comments conversation
	- Partner mode, explain changes, redo by hand
- intéressant: chat window ou CLI AI => documentation dans l'IDE
- intéressant: se comprendre
- intéressant: challenge arts, challenge not being dumb
- intéressant: se questionner, introspection sur les gestes et étapes d'un workflow

## **Context is important—but comes with a heavy mental load**

<!-- Chunk #15 -->
No matter _what_ we’re doing, we’re constantly trying to hold way too much information in our heads. I always imagine it like carrying a giant basket filled with random things like eggs, water bottles, watermelons, toy cars, a cactus (I hope you’re picturing a Dr. Seuss scene). And I’m on the go, so things are rocking all around the basket, and more things keep being added, and then an egg falls and cracks, one of the water bottles starts to spill over, a toy car keeps banging into one of the watermelons . . . basically anxiety in a metaphor.

Step 1: Create its personality
If someone were to ask you, “Hey, do you want a really smart, eager, motivated, capable person by your side who knows what you know and is super-enthusiastic to tackle anything you want?” you’d probably say yes in a heartbeat. Well, you’re in luck, because that’s exactly what Projects can be.

<!-- Chunk #17 -->
Step 2: Feed it information

<!-- Chunk #18 -->
Step 3: Let it cook

NOTES
Ecosystem Pressure & Career Implications
From a team & career standpoint:
- Software demand grows: even if AI boosts productivity, new use cases and features emerge faster. 
- Tooling wont reduce complexity by itself: meaningful automation often surfaces new structural dependencies (deployments, observability, model evaluation). 
- Junior engineers need mentorship: the talk explicitly stresses building foundational competence early — systems thinking and debugging skills scale better than rote tool knowledge.

Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't I?
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fear-learning-vancouver-clarifying-journey-realities-rand-hendriksen-xzsbc/
Like a shag carpet drenched in spilled soda pop, this looming dread that _everyone else is doing it, so why can't I_ formed the subtle but uncomfortably ever-present base for so many conversations I started wondering if it was I who brought the doom (wouldn't be the first time). So I listened, and observed, and confirmed that no, it wasn't me. It was everyone.
