# My AI Journey Part 2: From Bricklayer to Director

## 1. The "AI Fatigue" (Emotional Hook)
*   **The Vibe:** Honest, vulnerable.
*   **Key Point:** Acknowledge the "Guilt of the Newcomer." Everyone feels like they are falling behind. It’s reminiscent of the old "JavaScript Fatigue," but faster.
*   **Draft Connection:** Use the quote about "shag carpet drenched in spilled soda pop" (dread) or the "Tech Radar is saturated" point.

## 2. The Shift: From God-Mode to Team Lead
*   **The Insight:** We are moving from a "God-Mode" single agent (the solo coder typing every line) to a **Team of Specialists** led by a **Director**.
*   **The Metaphor:** You aren't just a bricklayer anymore; you're the Architect/Foreman.
*   **The Reality:** This isn't "less work." It’s *management* work. It requires a different headspace (orchestration vs. implementation).

## 3. The Trap: The "Junior Reviewer" Paradox
*   **The Problem:** If you are the Director, the AI is the "Junior" doing the typing.
*   **The Risk:** "We are reviewing code faster than we can understand it."
*   **Consequence:** We risk becoming dependent. We trade long-term mastery/understanding for short-term output. This is where the anxiety comes from—losing touch with the craft.

## 4. The Solution: Context is the New Code
*   **The Pivot:** How do you regain control? By mastering **Context**.
*   **Actionable Strategy:** Documentation is no longer just for humans; it’s the "prompt" for the machine.
*   **The "New IHM":** We need to redefine our interaction. It’s not just a chat window; it’s about building a "Shared Understanding" (Context) that the AI can work within.
*   **Key Takeaway:** Writing specs/docs *is* the new form of coding.

## 5. Conclusion: A Balanced Reality
*   **Closing Thought:** We aren't obsolete; we are evolving.
*   **Final Message:** Embrace the "Director" role, but be a *hands-on* director. Don't let the "Junior" run the show.
*   **Draft Connection:** "This is a big shift for everyone... We are all trying to find our footing."
