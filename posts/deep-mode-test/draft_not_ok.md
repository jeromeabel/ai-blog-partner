## Tangents and Tools

I also tried using some other tools.

I once bought a mechanical keyboard that was so loud my neighbors complained. It had blue switches. I love the click, but maybe it's too much.

And don't get me started on coffee. I switched to matcha recently.

This quote applies to setting up your environment (not the coffee part).
